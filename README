NAME
sim.py - computes Lin similarity of a given noun and all other nouns in a given file

SYNOPSIS
python sim.py INPUTFILE INPUTWORD

DESCRIPTION
sim.py is a simple program which computes the Lin similarity of a given input noun and
all others nouns in the given input file, whereby similarity is defined as the ratio between
the amount of information in the commonality and the amount of information in the de-
scription of the two objects [1].
Dependency triples are extracted from the given input file and stored as features of the
nouns. The amount of information contained in every single feature is calculated accor-
dingly. Pairwise similarity is computed between the given input noun and nouns with at
least one similar feature. The fifty most similar words are displayed in descending order
of their similarity.

FILES
